# Sentinel 

The goal of this project is to create a self-sufficient time-lapse camera that can survive for over a year, exposed to the elements in climate zone 3C. The camera will take periodic snapshots from its vantage point and upload them over a cellular connection via SFTP. 

These images can later be combined into a time-lapse video by the administrator.

## Things to be aware of

1. The type of camera you choose its subsequent resolution impacts the amount of bandwidth you will consume in a given 30 day period. Make sure that you plan for upload accordingly.
